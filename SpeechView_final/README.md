# SpeechView Project

    This project is about utilizing flutter library to recognize voice input 
    and convert it into text string which will be displayed on the user's screen.
    The project aim is to create an application which append the text from 
    speech to text into a note file to assist noting in another way.

# Current progress

     Speech to text is implemented, the application pages are organized.
     The Microphone function for speech to text works properly for both
     website and on Android. Additionally, we have implemented local storage
     so when user re-open the application, they can see the files that they
     have added last time.
